            <h2>Reshaping the Global Economic Order</h2>
            <p>On December 27, 1945, delegates from 44 nations signed the Bretton Woods Agreement, establishing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Born from the ashes of World War II, these institutions were designed to prevent another Great Depression and rebuild the international economic system.</p>
            <p>Eighty years later, these pillars of global financial governance continue to shape our world, having evolved far beyond their original mission.</p>
