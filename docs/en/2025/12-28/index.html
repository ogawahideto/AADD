      <h2>The Day Cinema Was Born</h2>
      <p>On December 28, 1895, Auguste and Louis Lumière held the world's first commercial public screening of projected motion pictures at the Grand Café in Paris, France. For the first time in history, an audience paid to watch moving images on a screen.</p>

        <h3>First Films</h3>
        <p>The first Lumière program consisted of ten short films, each about 50 seconds long. One of them, "L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat" (Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station), reportedly caused audience members to scream and jump from their seats as they believed the train was about to crash into them!</p>

      <div class="fact-card">
        <h3>Ticket Price</h3>
        <p>The entrance fee for the first screening was 1 franc. The event was so successful that within a few days, the basement theater was seeing up to 2,500 spectators per day.</p>

      <div class="fact-card">
        <h3>Cinématographe</h3>
        <p>The Lumière brothers' invention, the Cinématographe, was revolutionary because it combined a camera, film processor, and projector in one portable device, weighing only 16 pounds compared to Thomas Edison's 500-pound Kinetograph.</p>
