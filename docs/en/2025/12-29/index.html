                    <h3>The Maestro of the Cello</h3>
                    <p>Born December 29, 1876, in El Vendrell, Catalonia, Spain, Pau Casals (known internationally as Pablo Casals) would revolutionize cello playing and become one of history's most influential musicians and humanitarians.</p>
                    <p>Before Casals, the cello was considered primarily an accompaniment instrument. Through his extraordinary technique, expressiveness, and innovations in fingering and bowing, Casals elevated the cello to a solo instrument of the highest order.</p>

            <h3>The Bach Ritual</h3>
            <p>For more than 80 years, Casals began every day the same way: by playing Bach's six cello suites. He described this ritual as "rediscovering the world each day."</p>

            <p>Casals' principles were as powerful as his music. In 1939, he began a self-imposed exile from Spain to protest Franco's fascist regime. He refused to perform in any country that recognized Franco's government, giving up countless opportunities at the height of his fame.</p>
            <p>In 1971, at age 95, he performed at the United Nations where he gave his famous "El Cant dels Ocells" (Song of the Birds) performance and delivered an impassioned speech for peace that moved the world: "This is the greatest honor of my life. Peace has always been my greatest concern."</p>
