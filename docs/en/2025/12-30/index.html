                <p>On <strong>December 30, 1936</strong>, auto workers in Flint, Michigan took the bold step that would transform American labor relations forever: they stopped working, sat down at their machines, and refused to leave.</p>
                <p>For <strong>44 days</strong>, these ordinary workers occupied GM factories in a standoff that would lead to the recognition of the United Auto Workers union and establish the fundamental right to collective bargaining in America.</p>
