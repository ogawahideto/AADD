            <h3>The Man Behind the Change</h3>
            <p>Mercurius was born in Rome to a family with Greek origins. His birth name had significant pagan connotations—Mercurius was the Roman god of commerce, eloquence, and trickery (equivalent to the Greek god Hermes).</p>
            <p>As a priest in Rome serving at St. Clement's Basilica, he was respected for his piety and wisdom. When Pope Boniface II died, the clergy and people of Rome selected Mercurius to lead the Church.</p>

            <h3>A Lasting Legacy</h3>
            <p>While John II's pontificate lasted only two years (533-535 CE), his name change established a precedent that has endured for nearly 15 centuries. Of the 266 popes since St. Peter, 81 have been the first to choose their particular name.</p>

            <h3>The Power of Names</h3>
            <p>John II's name change illustrates a universal human truth: names hold power and meaning beyond mere identification. His small act—changing from a pagan name to a Christian one—reflected a broader cultural shift as Europe moved from classical antiquity toward a Christian medieval identity.</p>
            <p>Today, leaders still carefully consider the symbolic power of names. From royal titles to stage names, how we identify ourselves shapes how others see us and how we see ourselves.</p>
