          <h3>383 Years of Revolutionary Science</h3>
          <p>On January 4, 2026, we commemorate the 383rd anniversary of Sir Isaac Newton's birth - the man who fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe.</p>

              <h4>A Christmas Miracle</h4>
              <p>Born prematurely on Christmas Day in Woolsthorpe, England. So small that, as his mother later recalled, "he could have fit inside a quart mug." Few expected him to survive.</p>

              <h4>The Plague Years</h4>
              <p>When Cambridge University closed due to the Great Plague, Newton returned home and experienced his "annus mirabilis" (miracle year). In isolation, he developed calculus, optics theories, and began formulating his laws of motion.</p>

              <h4>The Legendary Apple</h4>
              <p>According to popular legend, Newton observed an apple falling from a tree, inspiring his work on gravity. While the apple likely never hit his head, this period did mark when he began connecting terrestrial gravity with celestial mechanics.</p>

              <p>Newton dies at age 84. He was buried with full honors in Westminster Abbey. The French mathematician Alexis Clairaut eulogized: "Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, and the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish."</p>

      <h3>NEWTON GLITCHES</h3>
      <div class="facts-container" id="facts-container">
        <div class="fact active">
          <p>Newton once stuck a needle in his eye socket (between eye and bone) to see how it would affect his vision. This dangerous self-experimentation helped form his theories on optics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
          <p>Beyond science, Newton spent much of his later life studying alchemy and biblical prophecies. He wrote over a million words on these mystical topics—more than on science.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
          <p>Newton was famously antagonistic. His bitter feud with German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz over who invented calculus first consumed years of his life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
          <p>Newton died a virgin and never married. He had very few close friends and was known for his temper and reclusiveness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
          <p>As Master of the Royal Mint, Newton personally pursued counterfeiters. He had several arrested and some were executed for their crimes.</p>
