The Golden Gate Bridge wasn't just a bridge—it was a testament to human ingenuity, perseverance, and the American spirit.</p>

                    <h3>Joseph Strauss: The Unlikely Visionary</h3>
                    <p>"They said it couldn't be built. Too expensive, too dangerous, impossible given the conditions. But I knew better."</p>
                    <p>Standing at just 5'3", Joseph Strauss was a giant in engineering. Originally proposing an ugly hybrid cantilever-suspension span to save money, he eventually embraced the elegant all-suspension design we know today. What many don't know: Strauss had never designed a suspension bridge before taking on the Golden Gate.</p>

                    <p>19 men fell during construction. 19 men were saved by Strauss's innovation—a safety net suspended beneath the bridge.</p>
                    <p>The men who survived falls called themselves the "Halfway to Hell Club." Strauss's insistence on the net—at a cost of $130,000 ($2.7 million today)—was revolutionary for worker safety. Tragically, near completion, the net failed when a scaffolding collapsed, taking 10 men with it in the worst accident in the project's history.</p>
