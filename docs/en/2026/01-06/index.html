            <p>Just fifteen years after the fall of the Aztec Empire, something revolutionary happened in the shadow of the ruins of Tenochtitlan. In the midst of conquest and colonization, an experiment in education and cultural exchange began that would shape the intellectual landscape of the New World.</p>

            <p>The Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco represents a complex moment in history—a time of conquest but also of cultural exchange and preservation. While European colonization brought tremendous suffering, institutions like Tlatelolco created spaces where indigenous knowledge was valued and preserved.</p>
            
            <p>Today, as we commemorate its 490th anniversary, we can recognize this institution as both a tool of colonization and a sanctuary of knowledge that helped preserve aspects of pre-Columbian culture that might otherwise have been lost forever.</p>
            
            <p>The college stands as a reminder that even in the darkest historical moments, education can become a bridge between cultures and a repository of human wisdom.</p>
