            <p class="highlight">On January 8, 1547, in the Prussian city of Königsberg, a revolutionary act took place: the printing of "Catechismusa prasty szadei" (Simple Words of Catechism) — the first book ever published in Lithuanian.</p>

                    <p>Martynas Mažvydas wasn't born to privilege. As a young Lithuanian priest in a time of religious reformation, he fled persecution to Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia).</p>
                    <p>Studying at the newly established Albertina University, Mažvydas had a radical idea: to bring literacy to ordinary Lithuanian people by publishing religious texts in their native language.</p>
                    <p>At a time when Lithuanian was dismissed as a "peasant tongue" with no literary tradition, this was revolutionary.</p>

                <p>In the 16th century, the Lithuanian language faced extinction as Polish became the language of nobility and governance, German dominated commerce, and Latin was used by the church.</p>
                <p>Under these pressures, Lithuanian survived primarily as an oral language among peasants and common people.</p>
                <div class="fact-box">
                    <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
                    <p>Lithuanian is one of the oldest living Indo-European languages and the one closest to ancient Sanskrit. Some linguists call it a "fossil language" because it preserves sounds and grammatical forms that have disappeared from other languages.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Mažvydas' book arrived at a critical moment. Without written texts, Lithuanian might have joined the list of extinct European languages like Prussian, Polabian, and Gothic.</p>
