                <p>Born to Frankish parents and orphaned at a young age, Eudoxia was raised in the household of a powerful Roman general. Her intelligence, beauty, and ambition would carry her from these humble beginnings to the heights of imperial power.</p>
                <p>Her marriage to Emperor Arcadius in 395 CE was orchestrated by the powerful court eunuch Eutropius, who likely saw in her a potential ally. Little did he know that Eudoxia would soon outmaneuver him in the deadly game of Byzantine court politics.</p>

            <h2>A Reign Cut Short</h2>
            <p>Despite her power, Eudoxia's reign was brief. She died in 404 CE, likely from complications of pregnancy, just four years after her coronation. In her short time as empress, she had reshaped the imperial court, eliminated rivals, and secured her children's future - including her son, the future Emperor Theodosius II.</p>

                    <span class="point-number">01</span>
                    <p>Eudoxia's coronation marked a shift in Byzantine politics, establishing the empress as a figure of independent power rather than merely the emperor's consort.</p>

                    <span class="point-number">02</span>
                    <p>She helped establish the tradition of strong empresses in Byzantine history, paving the way for future powerful women like Theodora and Irene.</p>

                <div class="fact active">
                    <p>Unlike most imperial marriages, Eudoxia's was reportedly based on mutual attraction. The court chronicler Zosimus claimed Emperor Arcadius fell in love with her after seeing her portrait.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact">
                    <p>Eudoxia was the first empress to appear on Byzantine coins with the same imperial regalia as the emperor, visually equalizing her status with her husband.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact">
                    <p>John Chrysostom allegedly compared Eudoxia to Herodias (who demanded John the Baptist's head) in a sermon, precipitating his downfall. This story may be apocryphal but highlights their legendary conflict.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact">
                    <p>Eudoxia was named "Most Illustrious" (illustrissima) before being elevated to "Most Noble" (nobilissima) and finally "Augusta" - titles that carried real political weight.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact">
                    <p>She died at approximately age 27, having mothered five children who survived infancy - a remarkable feat considering the high infant mortality of the era.</p>
