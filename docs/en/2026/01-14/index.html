                    <p>When 28-year-old King Henry III chose 12-year-old Eleanor as his bride, it wasn't for love but for strategic alliance. Eleanor, though young, came from the powerful Provence region with connections to both France and the Mediterranean.</p>
                    <p>Despite their arranged marriage and significant age gap, historical accounts suggest they developed genuine affection. Eleanor became one of the most influential queens in English history, bearing five children and actively participating in politics.</p>

            <div class="story-content">
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>While often overshadowed by more famous royal marriages, Henry and Eleanor's union fundamentally reshaped England. Their renovation of Westminster Abbey established it as the primary royal ceremonial venue—a tradition that continues to this day.</p>
                    <p>Their marriage strengthened England's continental connections and diversified its culture at a pivotal time. Eleanor's family network in Provence, Savoy, and France created diplomatic channels that gave England broader European influence.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps most significantly, their son Edward I would become one of England's most consequential kings, reforming law and expanding royal power in ways that still influence modern governance.</p>
