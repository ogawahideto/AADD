                <div class="text-column">
                    <p>Elizabeth Tudor was never supposed to be queen. Born to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, she was declared illegitimate after her mother's execution when she was just two years old.</p>
                    <p>By 1559, England had endured religious turmoil, economic crisis, and the loss of its last continental territory. The previous monarch, Mary I, had burned hundreds of Protestants at the stake, earning the nickname "Bloody Mary."</p>
                    <p>When Elizabeth inherited the crown, England was:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nearly bankrupt from failed wars</li>
                        <li>Torn apart by religious conflict</li>
                        <li>Vulnerable to invasion by France and Spain</li>
                        <li>Suffering from failed harvests and inflation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Few believed a woman could rule effectively. Elizabeth would prove them wrong.</p>

                        <h3>The Procession</h3>
                        <p>Elizabeth rode through London streets lined with cheering crowds. The road was covered in gravel and blue cloth. People threw flowers and coins, shouting blessings.</p>
                        <div class="timeline-fact">Unlike previous monarchs who kept distant, Elizabeth stopped repeatedly to thank the common people, establishing her image as "the people's queen."</div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="timeline-event hidden" id="event-2">
                        <h3>The Recognition</h3>
                        <p>Inside Westminster Abbey, Elizabeth was presented to the people in all four directions, with the crowd shouting "Yea, yea!" to acknowledge her as rightful queen.</p>
                        <div class="timeline-fact">The ceremony was conducted partly in English rather than Latin—a bold statement about religious reform that Elizabeth was carefully planning.</div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="timeline-event hidden" id="event-3">
                        <h3>The Anointing</h3>
                        <p>The most sacred part of the ceremony: Elizabeth was anointed with holy oil on her hands, breast, and forehead, symbolizing her divine appointment.</p>
                        <div class="timeline-fact">Elizabeth insisted on being anointed as kings were, with the same sacred oil, breaking with tradition for female monarchs.</div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="timeline-event hidden" id="event-4">
                        <h3>The Crowning</h3>
                        <p>The Archbishop placed St. Edward's Crown on Elizabeth's head. Trumpets blared, and the peers of England put on their coronets in unison.</p>
                        <div class="timeline-fact">The heavy crown was so uncomfortable that Elizabeth later joked she needed to stop the ceremony to let her neck rest!</div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="timeline-event hidden" id="event-5">
                        <h3>The Banquet</h3>
                        <p>A lavish feast followed at Westminster Hall, with Elizabeth seated beneath a canopy of estate. The champion of England rode into the hall and threw down his gauntlet, challenging anyone who denied Elizabeth's right to rule.</p>
                        <div class="timeline-fact">The banquet was so expensive it nearly bankrupted the already struggling treasury, but Elizabeth knew the importance of spectacle in securing her position.</div>

                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>1. The Missing Bishop</h3>
                    <p>All but one of England's bishops refused to crown Elizabeth because they were loyal Catholics. The Bishop of Carlisle finally agreed, but couldn't perform the full ceremony due to his lower rank.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>2. The Secret Protestant</h3>
                    <p>During the ceremony, Elizabeth quietly whispered to her ladies that the communion bread and wine were just symbols, revealing her Protestant leanings even as she outwardly followed Catholic rituals.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>3. The Married Queen?</h3>
                    <p>Elizabeth received a wedding ring during her coronation and referred to England as her husband, beginning her lifelong claim to be "married to the realm" rather than any mortal man.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>4. The Royal Scent</h3>
                    <p>The streets were fumigated with perfumes and incense for Elizabeth's procession—not just for ceremony but to combat the notorious stench of Tudor London.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>5. The Tudor Superstition</h3>
                    <p>Elizabeth scheduled her coronation based on astrological calculations for the most favorable date. Her father Henry VIII had done the same, as the Tudors were deeply superstitious.</p>
